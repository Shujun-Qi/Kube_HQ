This is the code for CPS510 Final Project by Shujun Qi

All the code in this zip is writen by myself. The part for SAFE engine and NFS image is not included in this repo.

1. The Kubernetes cluster configuration shell scripts are in the "Kubernetes Settings" folder. I hand write the shell but I referenced Kuberentes office documents.

2. The Headquarter service configuration, image build and code for flask server that runs in the container are in the "HQ" folder.

3. The code and shell script for remote storage system server are in the "RemoteStorage" folder.

4. The code and image build for initContainer are in the "Scout" folder.

5. The user pod configuration yaml files are in the "UserPod" folder.
